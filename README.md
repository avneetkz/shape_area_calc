# Shape_area_calc
In this program, We will ask the user to input the shape’s name. If it exists in our program then we will proceed to find the entered shape’s area according to their respective formulas. If that shape doesn’t exist then we will print “Sorry! We cannot find this shape.” message on the screen.
